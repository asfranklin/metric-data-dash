# metric-data-dash
Intuitive Metrics Dashboard &amp; Data Manager for creating and maintaining reports that present visual and statistical analysis of targets or goals, tracking production output, total pacing predictions, historical comparisons, accounts summary, creating custom filters/views, hosting collaborative discussion boards and idea panels, integration with Google Sheets, etc... This is my first attempt for a Full Stack Web Application that will be the main showcased project in my developer portfolio before I finally start applying for jobs and quit sales!

Here I will keep ideas to create functionality for and incorporate into the application. This is going to be built using JavaScript on Nodejs, Google Apps Script, integration with Google Sheets, Google Maps & other Google API's, jQuery, and I am planning to launch it as a React.js App - THAT IS UNSURE AT THIS POINT.


Some Ideas to Consider:
Avg Sale Cycle-Contact to Close
Which activities should I focus on to meet my goals?
How does my sales cycle compare to my colleaguesâ€™?
Is my current pipeline sufficient, overcrowded or slim?
How are we progressing against goals?
How much are we booking this month?
button to track how many medadv transfers
button to time stamp in and time stamp out to see hours - maybe even breaks?
checkbox to send emails?
auto populate forms and sheets - like client form
filter client table by many items and multiple drop down inputs
display current weather in clients region
API for actual med suppp quotes to populate
import range of html tables or lists
link to my personal profile with web dev certs
change chart by tab- now- previous month - all time - etc.
all clients, clients this month, or last month etc.. filter or options
user add objections commonly faced and or 
ability to add notes to existing clients
delete client button
checkboxes on each client to select multiple and click a delete function button for all checked
share functionality
api to list most recent posts from social media
time stamp to track hours
chart.js additions - multiple charts tabs
live table filter options by product, state, month, carrier, etc...
drug search DDL functionality
Map of all clients with pins added by zip
